<h2>Contacts Index</h2>

<p>The <strong>Contacts</strong> screen works very much like an address book. You can look up information about existing contacts 
by clicking on any of the hyperlinked contact names.</p>

<p>You can see all of the available contact listings by choosing the <strong>show all</strong> option. Alternatively, you 
can restrict the number of visible contacts to those lastnames starting with specific letters of the alphabet. [Note: you are
only able to restrict to specific alphabet letters if there are entries that exist for those letters].</p>

<p>Under the contacts module you can store and retreive information such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>First Name, Last Name, and Display Name</li>
	<li>Company, Title, and Type</li>
	<li>Address 1, Address 2, City, State, Zip</li>
	<li>Phone 1, Phone 2, Mobile Phone</li>
	<li>Email 1, Email 2, ICQ</li>
	<li>Birthday</li>
	<li>Contact Notes</li>
</ul>

<p>New contacts are added by clicking on the <strong>New Contact</strong> button. Detailed information about adding
new contacts, editting existing contacts, or deleting contacts is presented on the <strong>Add, Edit, or Delete</strong>
 Contacts help page.</p>

<p> Currently, the <strong>contacts module</strong> is not integrated with either the <strong>user module</strong>
or the <strong>company module</strong>. Furthermore, to date, the data stored in this module has not be used by 
other modules.</p>

<p>The overall objective of the <strong>contacts module</strong> was to create a centralized location where users of 
the system could access contact information. However, this may not be desireable in some circumstances. For example,
if you are providing your <strong>clients</strong> with <strong>read access</strong> to your installation, they
will be able to view your <strong>contacts listing</strong> and may thereby gain access to your full client list.</p>

<p>The <strong>private entry</strong> does not work as you might expect either. For instance, if you create a user 
with <strong>read only</strong> permission for the <strong>contacts module</strong>, they will be able to see a listing
of <strong>all contact entries</strong>. However, if they try to get details on a <strong>specific contact</strong> they 
will encounter a <strong>permission denied</strong> error message. This would occur for all entries, regardless of whether
marked as a <strong>private entry</strong> or not.</p>

<p>[The behavior described above existed in the 15 Mar 2003 CVS version of PSA 1.0 alpha.]</p>

<p>If you are concerned about other PSA users viewing the <strong>contacts listing</strong>, you may want to 
<strong>disable</strong> this PSA module in the <strong>System Admin</strong> section. Alternatively, you 
could <strong>deny access</strong> to this module to specific users.</p>

<p>To date, the <strong>contacts module</strong> has not received much attention from current development team, and 
will probably be rewritten as part of an amalgamated <strong>user</strong> or <strong>company</strong> submodule. If you 
have suggestions on how you think the <strong>contacts module</strong> should function, please send us your ideas.</p>

<h3>Searching within contacts</h3>
<p>If you want to look for especific information, you can type it in the search box. The search will be made on the following fields:</p>
<ul>
	<li>First name</li>
	<li>Last name</li>
	<li>Company name</li>
	<li>Display name</li>
	<li>Email</li>
	<li>Notes</li>
</ul>
<p>The search filter will be mantained until you click on the <b>reset search</b> button.</p>
