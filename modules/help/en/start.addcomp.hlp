<h2>Adding a Company</h2>
<style type="text/css">

</style>

<p>The first thing you need to do is to add a company.&#160; A company may
be&#160;one that&#160;you will be doing your work for (that is, your
client) or it could be the company that you work for.&#160; All users are
associated with a company as are all projects.</p>

<p>Log in as the Administrator with a username of <strong>admin</strong>
and a password of <strong>passwd</strong> (this is the default password but
we recommend that you change it).</p>

<p>Select <strong>Companies &amp; Clients</strong> from the left navigation
menu. If this is a fresh install&#160;you will see that the results table
is empty.</p>

<p>Click o&#173;n the <strong>new company</strong> button.&#160; You will
be presented with an input form.&#160; As an example we'll call this
company <strong class="c1">Xinul</strong>.&#160; Fill in some of the other
fields with any sort of information. For the moment, leave the company
owner as the admin user.</p>

<p>Click o&#173;n&#160;the <strong>submit</strong> button at the bottom of
the form.&#160; You will be taken back to the Company Index page where you
started.&#160; There should now be o&#173;ne entry in the list.&#160; It
will show that your new company has no active or archived projects.</p>

<p>Now create another company.&#160; As an example we'll call it <strong
class="c1">Swodniw</strong>.
