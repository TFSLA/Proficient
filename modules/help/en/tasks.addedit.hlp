<h3>Dynamic Tasks</h3>

Dynamics tasks are tasks which inherit their task properties, ( start date, end date, progress ), from their child tasks. A dynamic task's starting date will be the earliest starting date of its children and its end date will be the last end date of its children.

To use dynamic tasks you must check the dynamic task check box for the dynamic task and then specify the dynamic task as the parent task for each child task.
