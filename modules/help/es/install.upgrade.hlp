<h2>Upgrading an Existing Version</h2>
<p>Here is a general outline of how to upgrade your existing version of PSA (probably version 0.2.1 or 0.2.2)<p>
<ol>
	<li>Download the latest release and follow the install instructions placing it in a new directory.</li>
	<li>Create a copy of your existing PSA database.</li>
	<li>Edit the database parameters in the config.php file to point to this copied db.</li>
	<li>Apply the upgrade script to the copied db.</li>
	<li>Test out the new version of PSA.  If all is well then promote this version to production and archive your old data (just in case).  If there is a problem then let up know.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Upgrading to Version 1.0</h3>
Version 1.0 incorporates many additions and modifications to existing database structure.&nbsp; You need to apply the script upgrade_022_to_100.sql to your MySQL database to upgrade from wither version 0.2.1 or 0.2.2.<br />
<br />
<br />

<h3>Upgrading PSA 1.0 alpha 1 to PSA 1.0 alpha 2</h3>
The task_log, tasks and projects tables have all changed slightly from alpha 1 to alpha 2. You will need to upgrade your database to take advantage of these improvements.<br />
<br />
Apply the <code>upgrade_alpha2_to_beta1.sql</code> script to your database copy.<br />
<br />
The example below assumes the following configuration. Please modify the example commands to match your local settings. These commands are executed from the commandline within the PSA database directory.<br />
<br />
<strong>
$dPconfig['dbname'] = "dp_1_0_alpha";<br />
$dPconfig['dbuser'] = "dp_user";<br />
$dPconfig['dbpass'] = "dp_pass";<br />
</strong>
<br />

<h3>Upgrading PSA 1.0 alpha 2 to PSA 1.0 beta 1</h3>
Beta 1 includes two major security improvements.  Changes were made to prevent a vulnerability caused by malicious injection of SQL into the username and password fields.  The password encryption method was also changed in line with recommendations from MySQL.<br />
<br />
Apply the <code>upgrade_alpha2_to_beta1.sql</code> script to your database copy.<br />
<br />
There is a configuration variable, <code>check_legacy_password</code>, that also needs to be set to <code>true</code>.
<pre>$dPconfig['check_legacy_password'] = true;</pre>
This will capture a password verified under the old encyption scheme and upgrade on the first successful login of the user.<br/>
