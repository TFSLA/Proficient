I got some ideas for the email gateway (actually most of it) from the VA 
Mail Processor.  Not sure where I found that though.  I can't seem to find 
it on freshmeat.net, sourceforge.net, or VA's website.  

I'd also like to thank Voxel Dot Net, Inc. for inspriration and general 
technical help when it came to the mailing list and stuff like that.  
Granted, I work for them, but I have to mention that we are an 
extremely cool hosting company with extremely cool people.  We are also 
probably the heaviest testers of Ticketsmith.  Check out:

Lastly, special thanks to Apache, PHP, and MySQL for being such cool projects!
