Installing gateway.pl for dotProject.  Gateway.pl is a Perl executable
that takes incoming email to a specific mail address and forwards it
to the ticketsmith module.

QUICK START:

1. Make sure gateway.pl (which is in the dotproject/includes directory)
   is executable:

       chmod a+x gateway.pl

2. Check the first line of gateway.pl and make sure it matches your system,
   on UNIX/Linux systems it should read:

       #!/usr/bin/perl -w

   or whatever the path to your Perl executable is.

   Windows systems need a windows path, which includes a drive letter
   and backslash path separators (as in the supplied file).

   The -w is optional and forces perl to report all warnings.

3. Configure your MDA (Mail Delivery Agent) or MTA (Mail Transport Agent)
   to pipe mail for your support mail address to gateway.pl.

   Example 1:  Procmail recipe

      :0
      * ^TO.*support
      | /path/to/dotproject/includes/gateway.pl /path/to/dotproject/includes/config.php

   Example 2:  Using sendmail aliases

      support:	"| /path/to/dotproject/includes/gateway.pl /path/to/dotproject/includes/config.php"


PREREQUISITES:

1.	A working mail system that can pass email to the standard input
	of a program.  Sendmail, procmail, traditional UNIX mail systems
	all are capable of this.  I have no experience of Windows email
	systems and so cannot comment on their abilities.

2.	Mimencode - the command line utility required to extract MIME
	message components.  Only required if you are saving attachments.


GATEWAY OPTIONS:

In the top of gateway.pl you will find several optional flags that can be
set to control the operation of tickets.

These options are:

$send_email_report
	If set to a non-zero value an email will be sent to the
	$report_to_address with a URL link to the ticket within
	dotproject.  Highly recommended.

$send_acknowledge
	If set to a non-zero value an email will be sent to the
	sender of the ticket email, acknowledging the receipt.

$save_attachments
	If set to a non-zero value, email attachments will be
	stored as files in the dotProject Files module, under
	project 0.  If set to zero, attachments will be stripped.

	If saving attachments, mimencode must be on the system
	and in the execution path.

$skip_mime_prefix
	If set to a non-zero value MIME emails with non-mime portions
	will have them removed.  Otherwise non-MIME portions will be
	included as part of the message.

$report_to_address
	A partial or full email address of the user who should
	receive notifications of incoming tickets.  If it includes
	an '@' symbol, the entire string should be in single quotes
	and the email address will be used as-is.  If not, the
	dotproject site_domain will be added to the address.

$report_from_address
	A partial or full email address of the sender for email
	reports. Same rules as $report_to_address


$mailprog
	Full pathname of a mail transport agent that accepts -t
	to allow it to take a pre-formatted email and send it
	to the recipient(s) named in the headers.  Typically this
	is sendmail.
